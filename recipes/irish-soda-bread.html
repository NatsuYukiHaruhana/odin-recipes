    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Irish soda bread is a type of quick bread that relies on baking soda, not yeast, to rise. The bread contains
        buttermilk, which contains lactic acid. The acid reacts with the baking soda to create air bubbles, resulting in
        a perfectly risen dough.
    </p>

    <p>
        Soda bread became incredibly common during the Irish Potato Famine, as you can make it with only four
        ingredients: flour, salt, an acid, and baking soda.

    <h4>Ingredients at a glance</h4>

    <p>
        These are the basic, easy-to-find ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated Irish soda bread recipe:
    <ul>
        <li>Flour: This classic Irish soda bread starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>Margarine: Margarine has a higher water content than butter, so the results are often softer. If you want,
            you can substitute Irish butter.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Four tablespoons of sugar add the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
        <li>Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the bread rise.</li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the Irish soda bread.</li>
        <li>Buttermilk: A cup of buttermilk adds flavor and helps the loaf rise even higher.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg lends richness and flavor. Plus, it helps bind the dough together.</li>
        <li>Butter: Brush the unbaked loaf with a mixture of buttermilk and butter before you bake it for extra flavor
            and shine.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup margarine or butter, softened</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>¼ cup buttermilk</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, softened margarine, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir in
            1 cup of buttermilk and egg. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead slightly. Form dough
            into a round loaf and place on the prepared baking sheet. Note that the dough will be a little sticky.</li>
        <li>Combine melted butter with 1/4 cup buttermilk in a small bowl; brush loaf with this mixture. Use a sharp
            knife to cut an 'X' into the top of the loaf.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, 45 to 50
            minutes. Check for doneness after 30 minutes. You may continue to brush the loaf with the butter mixture
            while it bakes.</li>
    </ol>
